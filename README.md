Project Overview: Elevate U - Career Guidance App
Elevate U is a local, AI-powered career guidance application designed for students. It helps users explore suitable professional career paths by analyzing their responses to field-specific questions. The app generate a personalized career report that includes:

1. Career Match Percentage
2. Suggested Career Roadmap
3. Future Scope of the Field
4. Current Market Demand

Users start by entering their name and selecting a career domain (like Law, Software Engineering, Medicine, etc.). The app then presents a series of tailored questions. Based on the responses, an AI-generated report is created and saved locally.
